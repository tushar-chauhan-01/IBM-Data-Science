## IBM-Data-Science
All reading stuff related to IBM DS Specialization module wise

### MODULE-1 
This will give you basic idea of what data science is and will also help you discover all tools used to start your journey in the field.

### MODULE-2
This will brief about life cycle of data science projects and all the methodologies needed to understand or to solve data related questions.

### MODULE-3
This is very important module as it helps you improve your python skills which is must for any AI, Data Science field. 
It will provide yo with basics of HTTPS requests, API( Application Programming Interface ), Numpy, Pandas, Web Scraping to collect data for projects.

### MODULE-4
This projects helps us build the concepts for collecting data through api and web scrapping and then visualize the collected data to create understanding of tesla stocks and spaceX Falcon 9 landings.

### MODULE-5
This module will help to improve the relational database skills to store and extract and update adn retrive data from database and also shows how to connect database directly to jupyter notebook or any other notebook.

### MODULE-6
This module focuses on strengthing up concepts of using data by creating dataframe using pandas and doing operations using numpy and
in end we will be doing full analysis of house sales in USA.

### MODULE-7
This module focuses on visualization of data to get better understanding of data and to easily convey findings to others. 
We will be developing dashboard of airline to show trends flights over time.

### MODULE-8
This module builds strong understanding of ML algorithms required to model the data for predicting outcome. 
It shows use cases of SVM,Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree and more. 
This module helps to make decision of using appropriate models for a problem. 
There are multiple projects in the module but main project will be Rain forcasting where we will be predicting whether rain will fall or not using multiple algorithms and comparing them.

### MODULE-9
We will build a full prediction model using multiple algorithms after tuning them and then using best algorithm to predict whether Stage 1 boosters used in launch of Falcon 9 rocket will land or not.
This final module will also helps us develope strong reporting skills to convey our findings to stakeholder and other.
